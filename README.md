# Ngx Date Range

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 7.0.4.

This project began as a fork of [angular-2-daterangepicker](https://github.com/alsoicode/angular-2-daterangepicker) which works, but doesn't offer much in terms of type-safety or being able to be packaged for proper distribution as an Angular module, or for use with Angular's ReactiveForms module.

This codebase is heavily refactored from angular-2-daterangepicker, and works great out-of-the-box if you're using Bootstrap 4.x.

**This project is currently in development, and is not quite ready for production use.**

You can however, run this sample application to see current progress.

Items remaining:

- Positioning support for custom templating.
- Fix bug with "Cancel" button which causes selected date styling to be lost.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build Sample App

Run `ng build` to build the sample app. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Build Library

Run `ng build:lib` to build the ngx-daterange module for deployment to npm. The build articfacts will be stored in the `ngx-daterange/dist` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
